# Simulator For Cell Organization
This is a simulator for cell organization in a mobile wireless system where a user should be able to take various input factors in the cell system and find out the desired output.
 
Input Factor:
*Area size to cover
*Cell type: Macrocell, Microcell
*Radius of each cell
*Total number of frequencies allotted to the system
*Frequency reuse factor, N = I2 + J2 + (I * J); where I, J = 0, 1, 2, 3â€¦

Output:
Number of cells required
Number of channels per cell
Total channel capacity
Total number of possible concurrent call
